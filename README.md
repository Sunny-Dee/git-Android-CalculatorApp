My First Android App

To get my feet wet with Android Studio I made a simple calculator app. 

This app uses the new Constraint Layout view that pretty much works the same way as the Relative Layout, but makes it much simpler to work with. 

This app clearly shows you how to set up onClickListeners and how to deal with information passed on by the different widgets on the screen. 

Finally, the app also deals with the screen rotation (note: on rotation, Android destroys the view and creates it again) and making the text on the screen persistent regardless of the rotation. For this it's important that you also undestand the Android Activity lifecycle.
